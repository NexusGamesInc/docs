### Biomes

Biomes are three lanes where players attack or defend.
Each player controls one side of each biome, called their sector.
Sector's have 10 starting durability.

Each biome has a biome type.
There are ten biome types, each aligned to three of the five energy types.
This is referred to as the biome having an energy-alignment.

### Influences

Each biome has an influence that changes how players battle in that particular biome _(they don't affect other biomes)_.

Each biome’s influence is different from each other, and relate to one biome’s three energy-alignments.

Influences often provide agents in a biome with some type of skill while they’re in that biome.
