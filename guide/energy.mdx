### Energy Types

Nexus cards cost energy to play.
There are five types of energy.
The energy cost is determined by the energy symbols in its cost.

In addition to the five energy types there is also a generic energy type called Void.
Void energy can be paid for by any of the other energies.
The energy types and their symbols are:

### Energy Cost

The amount of void energy needed to pay a cost is indicated by a
number, between 0 and 15 , but can also be an undefined value.

Undefined values are void energy values that the player decides they want it to be.
Undefined values are indicated by a X void energy symbol.
For example, X could be 2 or 5
depending on what the player defines the values as.

### Energy Value

The energy value of a card is the total energy cost needed to pay for it.
The initial energy value of a card is its original energy value.

### Energy Store

ou pay for costs with energy from your energy store.
Energy in your energy store is available until spent, or the end of the current phase.

### Making Energy

To add energy to your energy store, you must make energy.
Energy is made by certain skills, effects, and card types.
Cards that can make energy must be locked to do so.
Making energy always has speed 3.

Typically only anomalies make energy, but other cards can sometimes make energy.
Card that make energy, say something like:
