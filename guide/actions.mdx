During each turn, players can take actions that affect the game.
Players can take as many actions as they are able to and want during a turn.

Actions that _do_ go in the queue:

- Playing a card
- Activating a skill
- Advancing
- Attacking
- Defending

Actions that _don't_ go in the queue:

- Converting a card
- Playing an anomaly

<Note>
  Reactive skills also go into the queue, letting players answer them with an
  action.
