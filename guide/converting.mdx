To convert a a card, put it on the planet from your hand, as its anomaly mode.

**When converting a card:**

- If the card's anomaly mode is not an uncommon anomaly, you choose which of the common anomalies the card converts into _(Light, Storm, Dark, Chaos, or Growth)_.
- If the card's anomaly mode is an uncommon anomaly, it converts into the uncommon anomaly.
- After converting a card, you do not show the card to your opponent while its in your hand.

**When converting a card:**

- Can only convert a card from its initial mode to its anomaly mode, and not from its anomaly mode to its initial mode.
- Can only be done during either of your primary phases.
- Does not enter the queue _(players canâ€™t answer a card being converted)_.
