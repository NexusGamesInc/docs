Keywords are common skills that are given a word as a shorthand.
Each keyword has an explainer text that explains what it does.
The following are examples of keywords of each skill type:

    Does not lock when attacking.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ready" icon="anchor" color="#3b82f6">
    Can lock the turn it arrives.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Reactive keywords

    gains that much durability.
