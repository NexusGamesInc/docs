This guide covers everything you need to know to play Nexus.
It's broken down into indivual pages, for different parts of the game's rules.

While this guide covers the rules of the game, **any card or effect in Nexus has the power to override the game rules**.
Modifications to the game rules made by cards and effects _always_ take priority.

The pages are meant to be read in order, starting with the Introduction.
