## The Nullshapers Universe

Nullshapers takes place in a simulated universe of called The Null.
In The Null there is an endless number of planets.
Each home to unique inhabitants, stories, and struggles.

## The Five Orders

A war of ideals has raged for centuries across The Null, fought between five orders,
each with unique values, characteristics, and themes.
The orders battle for control of universe's planets.
Sometimes coalitions between the orders are formed.
