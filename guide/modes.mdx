<Card title="Every card is a resource">
  In Nullshapers, all cards can used as resources, by converting and playing them as
  their anomaly mode instead of their initial mode.

</Card>

Often in card games, resource cards, like anomalies, are shuffled into a players deck together with other cards. In Nullshapers, that's not the case.
Every card in Nullshapers has two modes it can be played as: the initial mode and the anomaly mode.

**Initial Mode:**

- Is every card's default mode.
- Could be a agent, event,
  software, or hardware

**Anomaly Mode:**

- Is an anomaly.
- Unless its an uncommon
  anomaly, it is a common anomaly of the player's choice.

Once per turn, during either of the primary phases on their own turn,
players may convert a card from their hand.
