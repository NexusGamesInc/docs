In Nullshapers players take turns to progress their own game plan towards a victory condition.
The active player refers to the player whose turn it currently is.
Turns are made up of a series of phases.

Each phase is made up of a series of steps.
Each turn moves between the phases and steps in the same order every time.
Each phase or step allows or disallows players to do certain things.
